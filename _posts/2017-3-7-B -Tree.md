## B+ tree

B+ Tree Index
The B+ tree will be simplified in the following five ways:
1. First, you can assume that all records in a file have the same length.
2. Second, the B+ tree only needs to support single attribute indexing.
3. Third, the indexed attribute may be one of three data types: integer, double, or string.
4. Fourth, in the case of a string, you can assume that all string attributes and search keys in BadgerDB are larger than 10 characters, and the firtst 10 characters of each entry that is inserted into the index is unique.
5. Finanlly, you can assume that we will never insert two data entries into the index with the same key value.
